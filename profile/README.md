# 🥊 Friendly Streetfight Organiser

![ChatGPT Image Apr 27, 2025, 04_07_18 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/087682c8-1f1b-4ed6-b6a6-8302acc33d3c)


For coders who’ve stared at one too many semicolons and decided violence might be the answer. Born from the ashes of burnout and built on caffeine-fueled rage, this entirely fictional organization offers a safe, virtual space to vent your daily frustrations through friendly, metaphorical streetfights.
Currently operated by one sleep-deprived developer and a pervert lizard 🦎 that’s been stalking him from the ceiling for the past couple weeks. Ambitious? Absolutely. Functional? Not even close. Therapeutic? You bet.
Pull requests welcome. Baseball bats and Brass knuckles optional. (Rest In Peace Tyler Durden 🌹)


**Welcome, weary code warrior.**  
If you’ve ever wanted to hurl your laptop out the window after seeing `undefined is not a function`, you’re already one of us.

just remember:  
**You don't need therapy. You need a streetfight.**

*(And maybe some therapy too. But mostly the streetfight.)*
